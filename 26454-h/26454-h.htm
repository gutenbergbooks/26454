Rather! What a pleasant Cabinet Council. Why isn't the convivial

<h3>THE FUTURE HOPED BY HAWKINS.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>A Cockney Carol by a cruelly-used Coster-Investor. With apologies to
clever Albert Chevalier.</i>)</p>

<blockquote><p>
["I desire to express, and I cannot do it too strongly, that there is no
credit to be attached to the conduct of the directors in this particular case.
It would be more satisfactory to me if directors had a proper sense of their
responsibility. It is a cruel thing that people should be deluded out of their
savings by high-sounding names. At the same time, there is no criminal law
which will punish a director who scandalously neglects his duty, though he
takes his money. I think the law might well be altered."&mdash;<i>Mr. Justice
Hawkins.</i>]

<h3>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/208.png"><img src="images/208-300.png" width="300" height="425" alt="At the Sign of the 'Budget Shop." /></a>
<h4>"At the Sign of the 'Budget Shop."</h4></div>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, April 24.</i>&mdash;House nearly Counted
Out just now, although it's Budget Night and usual Resolutions not
yet passed. Catastrophe averted, and sitting continued. <span class="sc">Childers</span>
come back to old scene. Looking on from below Gallery, says it's
the quietest Budget Night he remembers. Usually scene one of
seething excitement. One or more Trades expect taxes affecting
them will either go up or go down. Lobby besieged by anxious representatives.
Nothing of the sort to-night. When <span class="sc">Squire</span> of
<span class="sc">Malwood</span> rose to expound his mystery, Benches not fuller than on
ordinary night. Of those present there was no speculation in the
eyes they turned upon the <span class="sc">Chancellor</span> standing at table. The
<span class="sc">Squire</span>, a great Parliamentary
artist, attuned voice and
manner to prevailing tone;
avoided anything approaching
oratorical style; plain business
statement to make; accomplished
it in fine head-clerkly
manner.</p>

<p>An unfailing tradition
about Budget Speech is that
it shall contain at least one
quotation from the Classics.
Mr. G. from year to year observed
this custom with
splendid effect. <span class="sc">Lowe's</span> <i>Ex
luce lucellum</i> is famous in history;
nearly became the epitaph
of a Ministry; certainly
was the funeral wail over a
carefully-constructed Budget.
The <span class="sc">Squire</span> to-night
felt bound to observe tradition;
but in accordance with
his nature did it modestly,
adventuring nothing more
recondite than citation of the
familiar line that serves to
mark <span class="sc">Wren's</span> resting-place
in Westminster Abbey.
<span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span> took opportunity
of remarking that he
was "disappointed with the
Budget." This mental attitude,
though not quite unexpected,
threw fresh gloom
over proceedings, and talk,
reduced to whisper, finally
died out.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget
brought in.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;The young men
behind <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> out
on the war-path. "Tell you
what," says <span class="sc">Legh</span> of Lyme;
"let's have <span class="sc">Bryce</span>'s scalp."</p>

<p>"By the Holy Roman Empire,
yes!" cried <span class="sc">George
Curzon</span>, to whom genial observation
was addressed. "Let's
get at him about his snubbing
<span class="sc">Sefton</span>, in matter of appointment
of Lancashire County
Magistrates. 'Twill serve a
double debt to pay. We'll have
a lark&mdash;'<i>Quelles alouettes!</i>' as it is written in the French translation
of <i>Great Expectations</i>, in the passage reporting conversation
between <i>Pip</i> and <i>Joe Gargery</i>. Moreover than which, we'll put a
spoke in business arrangements of Mr. <span class="sc">G.</span>, and stave off Home Rule
by so long."</p>

<p>"Be careful," said <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>; "ticklish subject, you
know. They're sure to have <span class="sc">Halsbury</span> up, and there unquestionably
was a degree of monotony about his appointments to
Commission of Peace."</p>

<p>"Oh bother <span class="sc">Halsbury</span>," said <span class="sc">Curzon</span>, to whom nothing is sacred.
"He's used to it by this time. You know what happened to the
viper who bit the Cappadocian's hide? <span class="sc">Halsbury</span>'s all right."</p>

<p>"Boys will be boys," said <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, looking at them
regretfully, and thinking of his own forty-five years. "But
perhaps it will be just as well if I clear out;" which he did, and so
missed a lively debate.</p>

<p>That Elderly Young Man, <span class="sc">Hanbury</span>, not in best form for such
operations. Lacks lightness of touch. <span class="sc">Henry James</span> also better
out of it. Gave performance serious turn, when he declared that in
borough of Bury <span class="sc">Bryce</span>, as soon as he came into office, appointed
eight Magistrates, all Liberals. That sounded very bad; Mr. G.
looked serious; some disposition shown on Treasury Bench to draw
apart from <span class="sc">Bryce</span>. All very well to talk about <span class="sc">Halsbury's</span>
goings
on; but if this sort of thing done by Liberal purists, things seem
rotten all round. When <span class="sc">Bryce</span> came to reply, he quietly added to
<span class="sc">James's</span> statement of case that, when he went to the Duchy, he
found of eighteen Magistrates sixteen were Unionists, only two
Liberals. He had, it is true, appointed six Liberals and two working-men,
whose politics he did not know. Bury Bench, accordingly,
now consisted of sixteen Unionists, eight Liberals, and two working-men.
Members wondered if <span class="sc">James</span> knew that when he made his
statement? Hoped he didn't. All very well with wig and gown on,
and brief in hand; but House
doesn't like this kind of
thing in debate.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Curzon's</span> statement about
sad condition of Magisterial
Bench at Southport, owing
to machinations of an iniquitous
Chancellor of the
Duchy, turned out to be not
more completely based on
fact than was <span class="sc">James's</span>. But
difference of manner in dealing
with case, everything.
No one took <span class="sc">Curzon</span> seriously,
and so no harm done.
His explanation of preponderance
of Conservative Magistrates
on Lancashire Bench
delightful. As good as some
touches of <span class="sc">Dizzy</span>, of whose
younger, lighter manner, he
much reminded old-stagers.
It was true, he admitted
that, on Lancashire Bench,
preponderance of Magistrates
was with Conservatives.
(Chancellor of Duchy gave
figures as he found them
arranged when he came into
office. On the Borough
Benches, 507 Unionists,
against 159 Liberals; on the
County Bench, 522 Unionists,
against 142 Liberals, a proportion
of nearly four to one.)
But how had it been brought
about? asked the Strayed
Reveller from the Corea.
"Why, it is because the
disturbing, mischievous policy
of the Right Hon. Gentleman
opposite" (this with
indignant sweep of the arm
towards Mr. G., feigning
sleep on the Treasury Bench)
"has driven into the opposite
ranks most of the intelligent,
respectable men,
from whom Justices are
chosen."</p>

<p>On <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Divison'">Division</ins>, Vote of Censure
on <span class="sc">Bryce</span> negatived by
260 votes; against 186. "I'm
not sure," said <span class="sc">Jokim</span>, whose
views of humour are limited, "that, what I may call the gain of
three hours lost, is worth the price paid; to wit, the opportunity
given to <span class="sc">Bryce</span> of disclosing the actual state of things in Lancashire
in the matter of Magisterial Bench, and the consequent doubling
of the Ministerial Majority."</p>

<p>"Well, as I remarked before," said Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span>, who had
come back for the Division, "Boys will be boys."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Employers' Liability Bill, with aid of Closure,
read Second Time.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Pretty to watch Mr. G. struggling with feeling of
expediency against temptation to make a speech. House in Committee
on Budget Bill; <span class="sc">Jokim</span> been discoursing at large on its proposals.
Quite lively. <span class="sc">Squire</span> of <span class="sc">Malwood</span> looked on, listening with
generous
approval, albeit he was target for <span class="sc">Jokim's</span> jocularity. This
time last year positions reversed. It was he criticising <span class="sc">Jokim's</span>
Budget. Now it was <span class="sc">Jokim's</span> turn, and the <span class="sc">Squire</span> magnanimously
stood the racket. Mr. G. sat by his side, an attentive listener,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg 209]</span>
evidently strongly drawn to join in the fray.
But it was plainly the <span class="sc">Squire's</span> show, and its
direction must be left to him. When there
followed long succession of eminent men
discussing Budget, Mr. G. felt that if he
remained any longer he must yield to temptation.
Accordingly, withdrew from scene.
Returned again an hour later; still harping
on the Budget; the <span class="sc">Squire</span> had spoken twice,
and there seemed nothing to be done but to
work off whatever remaining speeches had
been prepared in Opposition camp.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorington</span> dragged in case of farmer, and
small landowner; conversation turned on
Depression of Agriculture; the <span class="sc">Woolwich
Infant</span> presented himself to view of sympathetic
House as specimen of what a man of
ordinarily healthy habits might be brought
to by necessity of paying Income-tax on the
gross rental of house property. A procession
of friends of the Agriculturist was closed by
portly figure of <span class="sc">Chaplin</span>, another effective
object-lesson suitable for illustration of lectures
on Agricultural Depression. Mr. G.,
feeling there was no necessity for speech,
had resolutely withstood the others. <span class="sc">Chaplin</span>
at the table, proved irresistible. To him,
<span class="sc">Chaplin</span> is embodiment of the heresy of Protection,
Bi-metallism, and other emanations
of the Evil One. When <span class="sc">Chaplin</span> sat down,
<span class="sc">Premier</span> romped in, and, having delivered
the inevitable speech, went off home, soothed,
and satisfied.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget Scheme passed
through Committee.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Almost forgot we still have House
of Lords. Shall be reminded of their existence
by-and-by. For the nonce, they are
courteously quiescent, the world forgetting,
by the world forgot. Just a little flare-up
to-night. Ireland, of course; <span class="sc">Camperdown</span>
wanting to know what about the Evicted
Tenants Commission? Are the Government
going to legislate upon it, or will they
forbear? <span class="sc">Selborne</span> supernaturally solemn;
dragged in <span class="sc">James the Second</span> as the nearest
approach to any head of a Government quite
so wicked as Mr. G. Lords much interested
in this. Don't hear so much now of <span class="sc">James
the Second</span> as we did when at school. The
establishment of points of resemblance between
Governments of his day and that
presided over by Mr. G., a novelty in debate.
Imparted to political controversy a freshness
long lacking.</p>

<p>Just after seven, debate adjourned. For
all practical purposes, it might as well have
been concluded. But House doesn't get many
opportunities of debate; not disposed riotously
to squander this chance one.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Commons had Morning
Sitting; scrupulously devoted the last five
minutes of it to public business.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="sc">Operatic Note</span>,&mdash;There's not much magic
about <i>The Magic Ring</i> at the Prince of
Wales's until the Second Act, in which the
extravagantly comic "business" of Messrs.
<span class="sc">Monkhouse</span> and <span class="sc">Kaye</span>, the burlesque acting
of Miss <span class="sc">Susie Vaughan</span>, and the comic trio
dance between the two low comedians and
the sprightly soprano, Miss <span class="sc">Marie Halton</span>,
are worth the whole of Act I. When
is burlesque not burlesque? When it is
Comic Opera. Burlesque was reported dead.
Not a bit of it, only smothered; and it may
come up fresh for a long run, or at all events,
"fit" for a good spurt.</p>

<hr />

<p>Even the old-fashionedest Toriest of Tory
Farmers are longing, hoping, and even praying,
for the downfall of the Rain. If we don't
have it soon, and it may have arrived ere this
appears, Marrowfats, as <i>articles de luxe</i>, will
be "Peas at any price!"</p>

<h4>CHRISTY MINSTRELS OF NO IMPORTANCE.</h4>

<hr />


<h3>A WORK OF&mdash;SOME IMPORTANCE.</h3>

<p>"Let who will give me a plot, <i>I</i> will write their dialogue."
(<i>Extract from Uncommon-place Book of</i> Mr. <span class="sc">O. Wilde</span>.) Now
when the author of <i>A Woman of No Importance</i> and of <i>Lady
Windermere's Fan</i> has to find his own materials for a plot
(<i>"'Play-wrights'
materials for plots made up.' Idea for Literary and
Dramatic Advertisement" Note-book, O. W.</i>)&mdash;well, he does find
them, and makes them his own. (<i>"Adoption not adaptation. A
clear distinction.&mdash;N.B. I confer the 'distinction'" O. W.</i>) Certainly
"Our <span class="sc">Oscar</span>" possesses the happy knack of turning out some
well-polished epigrams up to Drawing-room date. And so it happens
that, during the first two Acts, when Mr. <span class="sc">Wilde's</span> <i>dramatis
person&aelig;</i>
are all gathered together, with nothing to do and plenty to
say, their conversation is light and airy, with an occasional sparkler
coming out (<i>"A summer night, with, at intervals, a brilliant meteor
flashing through the sky." Uncom. P. B., O. W.</i>), that crackles, goes
pop like the weasel of the old song, and "then is heard no more,"
as was the case with <i>Macbeth's</i> poor player, and, as he was a poor
player, his fate was not undeserved.&mdash;(<i>Mem. "A Lady Nickleby
or Duchesse de Malapropos, to misquote.&mdash;For example, she might
say, as quoting Shakspeare, 'Life's but a walking candle.'" O. W.</i>)</p>

<p>We all remember how poor <i>Mr. Dick</i> couldn't keep King Charles's
Head out of his manuscript. The Author of <i>No Importance</i> is similarly
affected. Left to himself for a plot, he cannot keep melodrama
out of his play, and what ought to have been a comedy pure and
simple (or the reverse) drops suddenly into old-fashioned theatrical
melodrama. During the first two Acts <i>Lady Hunstanton</i>, <i>Lady
Caroline Pontefract</i>, <i>Mrs. Allonby</i>, <i>Lord Illingworth</i>, <i>The
Venerable
James Daubeny, D.D.</i>, talk on pleasantly enough until interrupted
by the sudden apparition of the aforesaid King Charles the First's
Head, represented by the wearisome tirades, tawdry, cheap, and
conventional, belonging to the Lytton-Bulwerian-Money period of
the Drama, of which a considerable proportion falls to the share of the
blameless Miss <span class="sc">Julia Neilson</span>, who, as <i>la belle Am&eacute;ricaine</i>,
<span class="sc">Hester
Worsley</span>, in her attitude towards her audience, resembles the blessed
<i>Glendoveer</i>, inasmuch as it is "<i>hers</i> to talk, and <i>ours</i> to
hear."
Deeply, too, does everyone sympathise with lively Mrs. <span class="sc">Bernard
Beere</span>, who, as <i>Mrs. Arbuthnot</i>, a sort of up-to-date <i>Mrs.
Haller</i>,
is condemned to do penance in a kind of magpie costume of black
velvet, relieved by a dash of white, rather calling to mind the lady
whom <span class="sc">Charles Dickens</span> described as "<i>Hamlet's</i> Aunt," her funereal
attire being relieved by a whitened face with tear-reddened eyes. It
is these two characters, with <i>Gerald Arbuthnot</i>, Mr. <span class="sc">Fred Terry</span>,
who, like the three gruesome personages in <i>Don Giovanni</i>, will intrude
themselves into what might have been a pleasant, interesting comedy
of modern manners, if only it had had a good comedy plot.</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, the acting is admirable. Mr. <span class="sc">Tree</span>, as the
titled cad, <i>Lord Illingworth</i>, is perfect in make-up and manner.
Certainly one of the many best things he has done. It is a companion
portrait to the other wicked nobleman in <i>The Dancing Girl</i>.
(<i>"There is another and a worse wicked nobleman" N. B., O. W.</i>)
But this is no fault, and, indeed, it would be difficult, if not impossible,
to find fault with Mr. <span class="sc">Tree's</span> <i>Lord Illingworth</i>. Mrs.
<span class="sc">Tree</span> as <i>Mrs.
Allonby</i>, is a very charming battledore in the game of
repartee-shuttlecock,
who with eight other principal characters in the piece,
has nothing whatever to do with the plot. To the character of <i>Lady
Hunstanton</i>, as written in the Mrs. Nickleby vein, and as played by
Miss <span class="sc">Rose Leclercq</span>, the success is mainly due; and "for this relief
much thanks." It is here and in the comedy characters of the
<i>Archdeacon</i> (Mr. <span class="sc">Kemble</span> excellent in this) and of <i>Lady
Caroline
Pontefract</i> (who couldn't have a better representation than Miss
<span class="sc">Le Thi&egrave;re</span>) that Mr. <span class="sc">O. Wilde</span> shows what he can do as a writer
of comedy, both in the quality of the material and its introduction
at the right moment. (<i>"The right speech at the wrong moment, or
the wrong speech at the right moment, both are fatal. Thus is it
that comedies become tragedies, and tragedies comedies." U.P.N.B.,
O. W.</i>) At the Haymarket the "play's" not "the thing," it is the
playing. (<i>"Likewise the writing," O. W.</i>)</p>

<p>However, it is not for the plot, or for the Bulwery-Lyttony orations,
or for the familiar melodramatic situations that audiences
will seek the Haymarket. No, it will be to hear the Christy-Minstrel
epigrammatic dialogue in the first two Acts, to laugh heartily at
Miss <span class="sc">Leclercq</span> as <i>Lady Nickleby Hunstanton</i>, to smile on the
<i>Archdeacon</i>
and <i>Lady Caroline</i>, and to enjoy the first-rate acting all round.</p>

<h4>MEMS, FROM THE O. W. UNCOMMONPLACE BOOK.</h4>

<p>"Essentials for success of modern play are 'Latitude and
Platitude.' First being risky is saved by second."</p>

<p><i>Receipt for Play-making.</i>&mdash;First catch your epigrams: preserve
them for use: serve with <i>sauce piquante un pen risqu&eacute;e</i> distributed
impartially among a variety of non-essential <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>,
invented for the purpose. Provide fine old crusted copybook moral
sentiments, to suit <i>bourgeois</i> palate: throw in the safe situation of
some one concealed, behind door or window, listening to private conversation.
Add one well-tried effective dramatic situation to bring
down curtain on penultimate Act, and there's a stage-dish to set
before the appreciative B. P., if only it can be presented to them
effectively garnished by a clever and popular Manager at a first-class
theatre.</p>

<h4>FLOWERS OF FASHION.</h4>

<p>The Botanical Afternoon F&ecirc;te of last Wednesday was a brilliant
gathering in brilliant weather. Privileged is "the Inner Circle"
to have in its midst these lovely gardens. "The Flowers that bloom
in the Spring, tra la!" were all out uncommonly early&mdash;long before
the earliest worm, which hasn't a chance against these very early
risers. "All a-growing!" on the part of the flowers, and "all
a-blowing" on the part of the Band of the Second Life Guards.
Among the distinguished company present we noticed the Crimson
Queen, looking immensely well, the blushing Duchess of <span class="sc">Albany</span>, the
Duchesse de <span class="sc">Vallombrosa</span>, Admiral <span class="sc">Courbet</span>, in a striking
costume
of "deep yellow splashed with red" (where <i>had</i> he been?), the
Ladies <span class="sc">Daphne Pink</span> and <span class="sc">Callas White</span>, and Mar&eacute;chal
<span class="sc">Niel</span>.
For "<i>Uriah Heep</i>," who "loves to be 'umble," a Silver Medal was
awarded to Mr. <span class="sc">Pike</span>. "The prize, that's my point," observed the
sharp <span class="sc">Pike</span>. Funny Fish <span class="sc">Pike</span>.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="sc">A Penny Wise.</span>&mdash;The new import of the latest Budget may be

purposes) he believes it to be.</p></blockquote>

<p>No. 18. <i>John Hare, Esq.</i>,
as seen and painted by Sir
<span class="sc">John E. Millais</span>, Bart., R.A.,
"<i>The Hare Apparent</i>"&mdash;to
every spectator. But what
an unpleasant position! The
eminent Actor is either studying
a part, or has the Box-office
account-book in his
hand, and wants a quiet moment
for serious thought or
close calculation; and yet, in
the next room to him (No. 19),
one of Mr. <span class="sc">Orchardson's</span>
young ladies is singing and
playing a yellow chrome-atic
scale, and in the room overhead
(No. 17), Mr. <span class="sc">Nettleship's</span>
tiger has broken loose, and is
taking a bath. When rescued
from these surroundings, this will remain at home a Hare-loominous
picture for the family.</p>

<p>No. 28. "<i>Toe-Toe chez Ta-Ta</i>." Miss <span class="sc">Toetoe</span>, in blue, at work
and looking down, says to the other girl, <span class="sc">Tata</span>, who is maliciously
smiling at her, "Oh dear! I <i>do</i> hope that no one will look at my
right thumb or my toes! O Mr. <span class="sc">Woods</span>, A., why was my right
thumb left like this?"</p>

<p>No. 34. In this Mr. <span class="sc">Morley Fletcher</span> shows us a Female Martyr
in Tomartyr-coloured dress, preparatory to being taken off to the
<i>Auto da f&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>No. 45. "<i>An Undress Rehearsal</i>" <span class="sc">Stuart G. Davis</span>.</p>

<p>No. 49. "<i>On the Temple Steps.</i>" By <span class="sc">John Griffiths</span>. For
years we've known that <span class="sc">Griffiths</span> is "the safe man" to follow.
But, unless this is a work of pure imagination, anyone well acquainted
with the Temple Pier and the Temple Steps will naturally
ask, "Where are the Steam-boats?"</p>

<p>Nos. 51, 52, and 53. The first is a Harmony in Sea by Mr. <span class="sc">Henry
Moore</span>, A., and the second is Mr. <span class="sc">Miller's</span>&mdash;(<span class="sc">William</span> not
<span class="sc">Joseph
Miller</span>)&mdash;<i>Colonel Hornsby-Drake</i>. This Drake seems out of his
element, as he ought to have been floating about with the wild fowl
that belong naturally to the picture below.</p>

<p>Nos. 63-66.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">"Four little whitey boys out for a run,</p>
<p class="i8"> Ate early greeny food. Then there were none!"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Painted by <span class="sc">Amy Sawyer</span>. "Not a work of imagination, my dear
little boys, because you were seen by <span class="sc">Amy</span>&mdash;that is, <span class="sc">Amy</span> <i>saw
yer</i>!"</p>

<p>No. 70. <i>Study in P&acirc;tisserie.</i> Design for a chocolate ornament
covered with sugar. Recommended by Messrs. <span class="sc">Clark and
Hamilton</span>.</p>

<p>No. 71. <i>Lion in Desert.</i> Very tame. Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert Dicksee</span>.</p>

<p>No. 76. <i>The New Skirt Dance.</i> &there4; We strongly recommend
the study of this picture to admirers of the "Skirt Dance." It
shows how one of the male sex may attempt it&mdash;that is, according to
the idea of the designer, <span class="sc">Herbert Dicksee</span>.</p>

<p>No. 88. <i>Colonel W. Barnardiston.</i>
"First Chairman of
West Suffolk County Council."
Painted by <span class="sc">Hubert Herkomer</span>,
R.A. If he is "First
Chairman," it doesn't matter
what he is afterwards, since
he has been immortalised by
the admirable painting of
<span class="sc">Hubert Herkomer</span>. He'll
remain "First Chairman" in
the <i>Dramatis Person&aelig;</i> of this
year's Catalogue, at all events,
and be H. H.'s "Perpetual
First Chairman," too, be the
other where he may.</p>

<p>No. 103. "<i>Elder Bush</i>."
By <span class="sc">H. W. B. Davis,</span> R.A.
From the title you might
expect it to be the portrait of
a Presbyterian "Elder" named "<span class="sc">Bush</span>." But it isn't. Look at
it. It is the sweetest, most natural, perfectest of charming "bits"
of rural Nature in the whole show. There's no beating about this
bush; in fact this Elder Bush is one that is very hard to beat.</p>

<p>No. 130. <i>His Grace the Duke of Devonshire.</i> Encore! Bravo,
Mr. <span class="sc">Hubert Herkomer</span>. You're are a-going it this year, you are,
Sir! You've given the Duke all his Grace, and there's a kind of
orange tint about him, which, just now, is not without its political
signification.</p>

<p>No. 132. We must go to Kennington (<span class="sc">T. B. Kennington</span>) to see
"<i>The Queen of Love</i>." She is sitting on a tiger's skin, and has her
hand on the head of the savage beast, which shows its fangs. "A
<i>fang-see</i> subject," says <span class="sc">'Arry Joker</span>.</p>

<p>No. 158. <span class="sc">Honeymooners</span>. "Here we are again!" Same kind of
Stone Fruit from <span class="sc">Marcus Stone</span>, R.A. "Sparkles this Stone as it
was wont!"&mdash;<i>Cymbeline.</i> ii., 4. [<i>To be continued in our next.</i></p>

<hr />

<p><span class="sc">Among the Immortals at the Royal Academy Banquet Last
Saturday</span>.&mdash;H.R.H. made one of his usually happy speeches; the
Duke of <span class="sc">Cambridge</span>, the Earl of <span class="sc">Rosebery</span>, and Lord
<span class="sc">Herschell</span>
represented the comedy element; while Lord <span class="sc">Kelvin</span> and Mr. <span class="sc">Leslie
Stephen</span> were perfect in what, theatrically speaking, is termed "the
heavy lead;" and certainly their speeches were&mdash;ahem!&mdash;weighty.
Pretty to note how His Scarlet-robed Eminence entered the room,
not only with a grace all his own, but with His Grace of <span class="sc">Canterbury</span>
as well. Never was the President, Sir <span class="sc">Frederick Leighton</span>, more
effective in all his speeches, and especially when replying to the toast
of "The Academy," where the perfection of his speech lay in the
subtle concealment of its art, and in the genuine earnestness of his
advice to students <i>urbi et orbi</i>.</p>

<h3>ALL-A-BLOWING!</h3>

<h4>(<i>A Cockney Pastoral in Spring time.</i>)</h4>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><i>Who-o-o-f!</i> It's hot amost as Summer-time; yet what a blessed breeze</p>
<p>Is a-whiffing round the corners, and a-whoostling through the trees!</p>
<p>And the sunlight on the roof-slates, all aslant to the blue sky,</p>
<p>Seems to twinkle like the larfter in a pooty gurl's blue eye,</p>
<p>When you swing in the dance, and she feels you've got 'er step:</p>
<p>And the trees&mdash;ah! bless their branches!&mdash;through the winter weeks they've slep',</p>
<p>When the worrying winds would let 'em, all as black and mum as mutes,</p>
<p>A-waiting for the blackbirds, with their calls like meller flutes.</p>
<p>Just to whistle them awake like. Oh! but now they stir and rouse</p>
<p>Like a girl who has bin dreamin' of her lover in a drowse,</p>
<p>And wakes up to feel 'is kisses on 'er softly poutin' lips.</p>
<p>How they burst, all a-thirst for the April shower that drips</p>
<p>Tinkle-tink from leaf to leaf, washing every spraylet clean</p>
<p>From the sooty veil of London, which might dim the buddin' green</p>
<p>Of the pluckiest lime-tree, sproutin' o'er brown pales in a back-yard;</p>
<p>For these limes bud betimes, and they find it middlin' hard</p>
<p>To make way at windy corners, when the lamp as lights 'em through,</p>
<p>Like gold on green in pantomimes, is blown till it burns blue,</p>
<p>By the angry nor'east gusts. But the nor'east wind to-day</p>
<p>Is less like a rampin' lion than some new-born lamb at play.</p>
<p>Wy, the laylock's out aready, purple spires and creamy clumps.</p>
<p>Oh, that scent of shower-washed laylock! There's a somethin' in me jumps</p>
<p>As I ketch it round some corner, where the heart-shaped leaflets small</p>
<p>Cluster up against the stucco, as they did about that wall,</p>
<p>Grey, and gritty, and glass-spiked, of our tumble-down old cot</p>
<p>Out Epping way, in boy-time long ago, and quite a lot</p>
<p>Of remembrances came crowding, like good ghostes, in that scent;</p>
<p>There's the mother's call to dinner, there's the landlord's call&mdash;for rent!</p>
<p>And the call of the rooks,&mdash;and another call, fur off,</p>
<p>Like a whisper from a grave-yard, green and silent.</p>
<p class="i38">                                       Some may scoff</p>
<p>At a Cockney's chat of laylocks. I could bury my old phiz</p>
<p>In their crisp and nutty coolness, as I did when flirty Liz,</p>
<p>My first sweetheart, sent me packing, one Spring mornin'&mdash;for a while&mdash;</p>
<p>And them blossoms cooled my anger&mdash;most as much as the arch smile</p>
<p>Which won me back to wooin'.</p>
<p class="i28">                     There's a blackbird on the top</p>
<p>Of yon tall, half bare acacia, pipes as if he'd never stop,</p>
<p>Tryin' all his tunelets over, like a sort of talking flute:&mdash;</p>
<p>"<i>Chip-chip! Tsee-tsee! Chu-chu! Chu-rook!</i>" goes the bird of sable suit.</p>
<p>"<i>We-know-it! We-know-it! We-know-it! Bring-the-whip!&mdash;the whip!&mdash;the whip!</i></p>
<p><i>"Chu-rook-chu-chu! Chu-rook-chu-chu! Tsee-tsee-chu-chu-chip-chip!</i>"</p>
<p>So he pours his pantin' heart out in a song half tune, half patter,</p>
<p>Like a meller music-haller of the tree-tops!</p>
<p class="i36">                                     Ah&mdash;what matter</p>
<p>That 'tis only London's outskirts, that I'm a poor Cockney cove,</p>
<p>When this Wondrous Spring is on us? As my shallow on I shove,</p>
<p>And blare out my "All-a-blowing, All-a-growing!" down the streets,</p>
<p>There's a something fresh and shining-like in every face I meets!</p>
<p>Tis the Spring-love breaking through them! Wy, the very dirt looks clean</p>
<p>In the shimmer of the sunlight, and the shadow of the green.</p>
<p><i>All-a-blowing! All-a-growing!</i> When I shout, I seem to sing,</p>
<p>For my cry takes on a music. It's the very Voice of Spring!</p>

<h3>THE DEARTH OF GENIUSES.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Dedicated to the Right Hon. A. J.
Balfour.</i>)</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Cried Genius A. to Genius B., "Let's summon Genius C.,</p>
<p>And, to make a <i>partie carr&eacute;e</i>, we will call in Genius D."</p>
<p>And when they were assembled these solemn four sat down,</p>
<p>And they all read Mr. <span class="sc">Balfour's</span> speech, and read it with a frown.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Said Genius A., "No Geniuses? By Heaven, he's talking rot!"</p>
<p>And Genius B. replied thereto, "I can't say he is not."</p>
<p>And C. and D., the poets, who warble like the birds,</p>
<p>Agreed with Genius A. and B. in scorning <span class="sc">Balfour's</span> words.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"A Genius <i>may</i> arise, he says; that's coming it too strong;</p>
<p>Why, dash it, I can count up three in prose and eke in song!"</p>
<p>Thus A. began; the three replied, "You're not an egoist;</p>
<p>You quite forgot to add yourself, and so complete the list."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"We'll prove it on the spot," declared dramatic Genius A.</p>
<p>"You three shall sit as judges, and I will read my play.</p>
<p>'Tis a drama of the passions, all strictly based on facts,</p>
<p>And they break the Decalogue to bits in five exhaustive Acts."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"That <i>might</i> be good," said B.; "but <i>I</i>'ve a little thing, I guess,</p>
<p>Which ought to take precedence, a novel in MS.;</p>
<p>With characters so deftly drawn in all their changing scenes,</p>
<p>That <span class="sc">Thackeray</span> and <span class="sc">Dickens</span> must be knocked to smithereens."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>But C. broke in; his hair was long, his eyes were very wild,</p>
<p>He was in truth a strangely-garbed and most poetic child;</p>
<p>Said he, "Your plays and novels may all be very well,</p>
<p>But I've an epic poem here on <i>Happiness in Hell</i>."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And D., the pretty lyricist, he hummed and then he hawed,</p>
<p>"I've half a hundred sonnets here to <span class="sc">Mabel</span>, <span class="sc">Madge</span>, and <span class="sc">Maud</span>.</p>
<p>I'll read them first, and then I'll read"&mdash;the other three grew pale&mdash;</p>
<p>"My last new book, <i>The Musings of a Town-bred Nightingale</i>."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p style="margin-top: -0.8em;">And so they sat, and talked and talked, the argument waxed hot,</p>
<p>For each one was a Genius born, and none would budge a jot.</p>
<p>And till they settle who begins, and which of them shall yield,</p>
<p>I fear the "dearth of Geniuses"&mdash;see speech&mdash;must hold the field.</p>
